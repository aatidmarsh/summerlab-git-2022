Some species of peacock spiders have abdomens covered in tiny, curved, ridged scales. These scales reflact light and break it up (similar to the effects of a prism). These reflected colors make the spiders iridescent.

Some species of peacock spiders, for example Maratus jactatus (colloquially known as the "sparklemuffin" spider) will do a dance to seek out mates. The males have flaps on their abdomens that can unfold that they use in this dance.

Peacock spiders are venomous, but are not dangerous to humans because they are tiny (smaller than a fingernail!). They live in Australia.
